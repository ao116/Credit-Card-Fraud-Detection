# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to analyze a European bank dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. Two primary methods are used:
1. Clustering (e.g., K-means) to identify transaction clusters.
2. Classification (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression) for categorizing transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- The dataset consists of transaction records, where each entry is labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Project Steps

### A) Clustering
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and explore the dataset to understand structure and features.
2. **K-means Clustering**: Apply K-means to find transaction clusters and analyze patterns.
3. **Analysis**: Interpret clusters and identify common characteristics.

### B) Classification
1. **Data Preparation**: Balance classes and prepare data for classification.
2. **Classification Algorithms**: Use algorithms such as SVM and Logistic Regression.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results and Conclusion
Compare the effectiveness of clustering and classification in detecting fraudulent transactions, highlighting key patterns.
